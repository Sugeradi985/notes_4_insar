general the name on the file is something like：

## ASA_IMS_1PPIPA20050402_095556_000000162036_00065_16151_0388.N1

ASA = sensor  —— ASAR传感器

IMS = mode and product (Image mode, SLC product)  ——成像模式，有很多种，WS，WSS，IM，。。。

1PPIPA = order number, not interesting   —— 订制的编号

20050402 = date  —— 数据获取的时间——UTC时间

095556 = IMPORTANT! This is the start time (it's not exactly what you see in EOLI SA, but you just  need to know it roughly so that you know the area)

000000162036 = Some kind of code, not interesting

00065 = TRACK  ——enviview里给出的解释是 relative orbit

16151 = ORBIT   ——absolute orbit

0388 = Some kind of code, not interesting
